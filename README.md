  Facial recognition works in three steps: detection, analysis, and recognition. Detection is the process of finding a face in an image. Enabled by computer vision, facial recognition can detect and identify individual faces from an image containing one or many people's faces. It can detect facial data in both front and side face profiles. Machines use computer vision to identify people, places, and things in images with accuracy at or above human levels and with much greater speed and efficiency. Using complex artificial intelligence (AI) technology, computer vision automates extraction, analysis, classification, and understanding of useful information from image data. 

The combination of Viola-Jones, HOG, and Single Shot Detector (SSD) for face detection offers several advantages over other methods:
*Robustness:* The combination of these methods captures both gradient and spatial information, making it more robust to variations in lighting, pose, and occlusion.
*Speed:* SSD is a fast object detector that can detect objects in real-time, and when combined with the computational efficiency of HOG and Viola-Jones, it can result in a fast and efficient face detector.
*High accuracy:* The combination of these methods results in a more accurate face detector, as it can effectively handle variations in lighting, pose, and occlusion.
*Adaption:* It is easy to adapt to new images or different datasets, as it can be trained on a large dataset of faces.
